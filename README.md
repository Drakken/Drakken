- 👀 In addition to physics, I’m also interested in functional programming, metaprogramming, and AI.
- :computer: I've programmed in lots of different languages, and OCaml is my favorite.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate remotely on projects involving OCaml.
- :factory: I'm currently working on SMA_star, an OCaml library for doing heuristic searches with the SMA* algorithm.
