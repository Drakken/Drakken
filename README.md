- 🌌 Hi, I’m Dan. I'm an old physics guy from back in the 20th century.
- 👀 In addition to physics, my interests also include functional programming, metaprogramming, and AI.
- &nbsp;**λ** &nbsp; I've programmed in lots of different languages, and OCaml is my favorite.
- 🌟 My latest project is SMA_star, an OCaml library for doing heuristic searches with the SMA* algorithm.
<!---
 - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate remotely on projects involving OCaml.
