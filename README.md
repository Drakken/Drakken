- 👋 Hi, I’m @Drakken.
- 👀 I’m interested in functional programming, metaprogramming, programming languages, and AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning random subjects that I don't know because I studied physics instead of CS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on remote projects involving OCaml.
- 📫 How to reach me: through this site if possible, or at my real name at AT&T dot net.
