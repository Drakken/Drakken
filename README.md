- 👋 Hi, I’m Dan. I'm an old physics guy from back in the 20th century.  
I've programmed in lots of different languages, and OCaml is my favorite.
- 👀 In addition to physics, I’m also interested in functional programming, metaprogramming, programming languages, and AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate remotely on projects involving OCaml.
- :factory: My current project is SMA_star, an OCaml library for doing heuristic searches with the SMA* algorithm.
- 📫 How to reach me: danbensen@att.net.
