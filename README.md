- 🌌 Hi, I’m Drakken. I'm interested in functional programming, metaprogramming, AI, and physics.
- &nbsp;**λ** &nbsp; I've programmed in lots of different languages, and OCaml is my favorite.
<!---
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate remotely on projects involving OCaml.
- :factory: I'm currently working on SMA_star, an OCaml library for doing heuristic searches with the SMA* algorithm.
